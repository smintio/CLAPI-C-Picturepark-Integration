# CLAPI-C-Picturepark-Integration
Sample of integrating Smint.io with Picturepark DAM using the Smint.io Content Licensing Consumer API and the Picturepark SDK

**Please note that this is only a simple command line application example, not a blueprint for full-fledged integration!**

If you want to integrate Smint.io to your software system, you should provide a proper plugin with configuration facilities embedded to your user interface. Find out more about the suggested integration features in the Smint.io Integration Guide, which has been provided to you when you signed up as a Smint.io Solution Partner.

While we are trying to show you a comprehensive example of synching Smint.io to your software system here, it is not yet complete - a lot of metadata mappings are still missing. We are working on it!
